# TravelTide - eBooking Segmentation Analysis

## The goal of this project is to segment users by their session and booking behaviour, as well as demographic data, to enable targeted marketing campaigns.
**TravelTide is an online eBooking startup, founded in April 2021 at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic. TravelTide leveraged its revolutionary data aggregation and search technology to offer the largest travel inventory and grow its customer base.** However, this hyper-focus on technology and growth came at the cost of leaving the customer experience underdeveloped, leading to poor customer retention.

## Business Problem:
Customers that signed up in previous years are booking fewer trips or not booking at all:
- **2021 Signups:** booked 60% fewer trips in 2023 and 52% did not book trips at all.
- **2022 Signups:** booked 30% fewer trips in 2023 and 29% did not book trips at all.

To address this, a new rewards program will be implemented. This project aims to segment the customer base for the marketing team to utilise in the communication of the rewards program.
