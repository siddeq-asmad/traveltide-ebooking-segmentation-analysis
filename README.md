# TravelTide - eBooking Segmentation Analysis

## The goal of this project is to segment users by their session and booking behaviour as well as demographics data for targeted marketing campaigns.
**TravelTide is an online eBooking startup, founded in April 2021 (at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic). TravelTide leveraged its revolutionary data aggregation and search technology to offer the largest travel inventory and grow its customer base.** However, the hyper focus on it's technology and growth, came at the cost of leaving the customer experience underdeveloped, which has resulted in poor customer retention.

In order to encourage repeat customers, a new rewards program will be implemented. This project aims to segment the customer base for the marketing team to utilise in the communication of the rewards program.

## Business Problem:
Customers that signed up in previous years are booking less trips or not booking at all.
- 2021 signups booked 60% less trips in 2023 and 52% did not book trips at all.
- 2022 signups booked 30% less trips in 2023 and 29% did not book trips at all.
